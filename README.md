### 1. Metadata Validation
   - **Name:** Ensures the existence and non-empty value of the theme name.
   - **License:** Checks for the presence and validity of the license type.
   - **License Link:** Verifies that the license link is an absolute and valid URL.
   - **Description:** Ensures the presence and non-empty value of the theme description.
   - **Homepage:** Validates the homepage link for being an absolute and working URL.
   - **Demosite:** Checks the demosite link for being an absolute and functional URL.

   - **Original Theme Information:** If the user indicates that the theme is ported, checks for the existence and non-empty values of the original author's name, homepage, and repository link.
